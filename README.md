# Wild Rift Discord Bot 

A custom Discord bot built using the [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) library and powered by [WildStats.gg](https://wildstats.gg/), designed to help Wild Rift players access builds, leaderboards, and player statistics — all from Discord!

## Features

### Builds
- View champion builds with `+build [champion]`
- Example: `+build Ahri` or `+build Miss Fortune`

### Leaderboards
- See top-ranked NA players using `+leaderboards NA`
- Paginated: shows top 10, and page 2 shows ranks 11–50

### Player Stats
- Fetch WildStats.gg player data (level, rank, win rate, KDA, MVPs)
- Parses dynamic script tags with JSoup for live data

### Extras
- Uses regex and script parsing for win rate, KDA, and match stats
- Fully event-driven using JDA’s `ListenerAdapter`
- Clean embeds with timestamps and hyperlinks
- Automatically fetches images and champion thumbnails
